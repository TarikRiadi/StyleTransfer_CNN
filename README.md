# StyleTransfer_CNN
Final proyect for the course Artificial Intelligence. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) "paint" any picture (input) in the style of a famous painting (style)
In this repository, you can find the images produced by the pretrained neural network. The style was taken from two different pastiches (both by artist Alfred Sisley)
and applied onto 3 different images for content: UANDES (a picture of our university's library), Snowy (a picture of a hill in Westminster, CO) and Space Shuttle
Independence (a picture of a space shuttle on top of an airplane at Johnson Space Centre).

An in-depth explanation of the algorithm and its parameters can be found in the power point and paper within ths repository. Please message me if you have any doubts.
